This page contains the R code to produce a Shiny App in which expression patterns of P. knowlesi A1-H.1 (De Meulenaere et al., 2025) and P. vivax (Zhu et al., 2016) genes can be visualised over the asexual blood stages.

In the first tab of the App, a P. vivax/P. knowlesi gene is entered, the ortholog(s) are searched, and an expression plot for the input gene + ortholog(s) is given together with similarity statistics of the expression patterns.

In the second tab of the App, up to 4 P. knowlesi/P. vivax genes are entered, and one expression plot is given for all input genes together.
